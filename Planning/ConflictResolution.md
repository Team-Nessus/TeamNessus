Project: Prep #1

**Communication plan:**
 
We will communicate using slack, Remo, or Google meet as a main resource for
communication. We will use Google Drive or GitHub to store any documents. 
GitHub as a project management tool for organization and tracking project 
progression.

We want to make sure that we create a supportive environment in which everyone
feels safe to communicate openly without judgement. We will make sure to
ask what each other thinks or feels about an idea and ensure that we understand
each other. We have discussed with each other the importance of feeling
free to ask for clarification on any issues at any time. We will have a
top of day and end of day meeting to reflect on what we have completed
and what is yet to be completed.

**Conflict plan:**

How we will talk about problems: allow each team member to have a voice and 
opinion. We will communicate with each other respectfully first, listen 
with an open mind and review any issues with constructive feedback. 
Finally, we will agree on a solution and move forward. 

Conflict will be addressed on an individual basis and be discussed 
between the affected parties. If the conflict is not resolved, the 
discussion will be elevated to the group level. A meeting will be set 
to discuss the issue and attempt to find a solution. If a resolution 
is not agreed upon by all members of the group, we will take a vote 
on the matter, taking into consideration: The relevance of the subject 
to the overall product effect on the group progress overall. 

If there is no resolution then we will seek advice from the academic team. 
We will consult a TA and if that doesn't resolve the conflict we will talk 
to the instructor. 

We will actively listen and communicate effectively to achieve the same goal. 

**Work Plan:**

GitHub Project will be used as our project management tool in order to track 
our progress on each task and assignment. The workload and type of work will 
be split equally among all team members.

**Git process**

We will use github for our repository for any of our code that 
we use for our project. We will create a branch for each section of the code.

**Standard hours**

We will set the meeting each day in Remo from 9 AM to 6 PM (regular class hours). 
Decisions will be made on what the objective will be for the day and 
then dive into more details about the objective. If work is done 
for the day we will call it quits earlier. We will convene at the 
completion of each task to make sure we are on the same page moving 
forward according to the completion of our project. Tasks will be 
discussed in a verbal discussion within the requirements of the project. 

**After hour communication**

We will discuss any pull requests or questions we have over the Slack and in Remo.

**Additional Comments:**
- 15 minute rule applies here and open communication.
- Have fun! Develop as a team.
